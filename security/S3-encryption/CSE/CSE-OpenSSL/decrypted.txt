Using customer-side encryption with Amazon S3 and OpenSSL involves encrypting data on your local machine before uploading it to S3, and decrypting it locally after downloading. This provides you with full control over the encryption keys.
Steps for Client-Side Encryption with OpenSSL and S3:
Generate an encryption key and IV (Initialization Vector) using OpenSSL:
Code

openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -pass pass:your_secret_password -P

This command will output the salt, key, and iv values. The key and iv are crucial for encryption and decryption. Securely store these values, as losing them will result in irreversible data loss. Encrypt your data locally using OpenSSL.
Code

openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in your_file.txt -out your_file.enc -K <your_key_hex> -iv <your_iv_hex>
Replace <your_key_hex> and <your_iv_hex> with the hexadecimal values obtained in step 1. Upload the encrypted file to S3.
Use the AWS CLI or an AWS SDK to upload your_file.enc to your S3 bucket. No special S3 encryption headers are needed for this method, as the encryption is handled entirely on the client side. Download the encrypted file from S3.
Use the AWS CLI or an AWS SDK to download your_file.enc from your S3 bucket. Decrypt the file locally using OpenSSL.
Code

    openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in your_file.enc -out your_file_decrypted.txt -K <your_key_hex> -iv <your_iv_hex>
Again, use the same key and iv used during encryption.
